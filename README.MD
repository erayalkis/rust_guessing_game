# Rust Guessing Game

This is a personal version of the [Rust Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) tutorial. I've added some personal notes to make things a bit easier to understand for myself and potentially others!

# Setup

1. Run `git clone` and cd into the `react_guessing_game` directory.
2. Run `cargo run` from your terminal.

# Dependencies

This Rust project uses the `rand` package to handle random integer generation.
